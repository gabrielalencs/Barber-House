    <p>Damn that place is real shit lol. Got there with the homies, music playing loooooud, a lot of beers and stuff you know? I felt very comfortable too, the air conditioner was insane. About the cut: the best of my entire life. The barber guy was a complete MASTER! The price was very expensive though, but I felt like it was worth paying. Best Cut Ever.</p>
